## minitalk mandatory

Creating a communication program in the form of a client and server.

The server is launched first, and after being launched it displays its PID.

The client takes as parameters:

• The server PID.

• The string that should be sent.

• The client communicates the string passed as a parameter to the server. Once the string has been received, the server displays it.

• Communication between programs is done using UNIX signals.

• The server must be able to display the string pretty quickly.

• Server receives strings from several clients in a row, without needing to be restarted.

• Only two signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2) are used.
